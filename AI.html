            <P style="width: 80%; text-align: center; margin-left: 150px;">Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest
                sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. It is a field of research
                in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive
                their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of
                achieving defined goals.[1] Such machines may be called AIs.

                Some high-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search);
                recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g.,
                Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools
                (e.g., ChatGPT, and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go).
                However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into
                general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and
                common enough it's not labeled AI anymore."[2][3] <br><br>

                The various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular
                tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning,
                learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] General intelligence—the
                ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field's
                long-term goals.[4] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of
                techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks,
                and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics.[b] AI also draws upon psychology,
                linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.[5] <br><br>

                Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,[6] and the field went through
                multiple cycles of optimism,[7][8] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as
                AI winter.[9][10] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed
                previous AI techniques.[11] This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer
                architecture,[12] and by the early 2020s hundreds of billions of dollars were being invested in AI
                (known as the "AI boom"). The widespread use of AI in the 21st century exposed several unintended
                consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about its risks and long-term effects in the
                future, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the
                technology.</P>

            <p style="width: 80%; text-align: center; margin-left: 150px;">Early researchers developed algorithms that
                imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.[13]
                By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete
                information, employing concepts from probability and economics.[14] <br><br>

                Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a
                "combinatorial explosion": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow.[15] Even humans rarely
                use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems
                using fast, intuitive judgments.[16] Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.</p>
